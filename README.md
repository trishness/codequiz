# codequiz

This assignment dove deeper into the aspects of JavaScript as well as elements of API. It required the creation of a JavaScript coding quiz that begins when the user clicks a button, cycles through predetermined questions with a running timer countdown. The score is kept by comparing the correct answer from the question array to the option selected by the user. If the answer is correct, there is no deduction from the timer countdown. If the answer is incorrect, the timer reduces by 5 seconds. If the timer elapses, the user is ended and the user is alerted to try again. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed, they are prompted to select a username, and the score with corresponding username is displayed on a scoreboard. The scoreboard tracks previous attempts by users through the use of local storage. This was definitely a challenging assignment.
